=============
Configuration
=============

You have to install sudo app in your system to
have enought privileges to copy/create library files in every user's home.

Open a terminal and su to root, then exec "visudo"

# visudo

Add a line like this:

#=============================jclic teacher==================================
YOUR_USERNAME    ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/jclicbrowser-sudo
#============================================================================

in YOUR_USERNAME put your system username.

========
Database
========

When jclic-browser runs first time it will create an empty sqlite 
database in:

   /home/_USERNAME_/.jclic_browser.db

To populate database exec this:

  $ sqlite ~/.jclic_browser.db < /usr/share/jclic_browser/utils/data.sql

Database is very big and take a few time to populate.

The file data.sql contains sql syntax to populate 3 tables:

 jclic = activities table
 zip_uls = url of each zip file
 img_urls = url of each gif file

To update data.sql with more recent information need to run
some scripts:

 $ /usr/share/jclic_browser/utils/jclic.sh

 This ask to download 3 different things:
   * List of all activities
   * All zip
   * All img

 If you want to download all zips avalaible need at least 800 Mb
 and some internet bandwich.

 To recreate data.sql run as root:

 # /usr/share/jclic_browser/utils/mostrar-infos.sh

 This uncompress every zip found and read description of xml included file
 to build data.sql with updated web jclic data.

 Author give data.sql updated to 2 Mar 2006, and will update file
 if needed.
